Get stats by campaign.

## Dimensions                Get performance statistics aggregated for _campaigns_. The campaign id appears  in the output as the first column.                Aggregation can be done by `hour`, `day`, `month`, or `year`. The aggregation  interval size is controlled by `intervalSize`. The time interval appears in  the output as the second column.                ## Metrics                The metrics reported by this endpoint are                .  | Metric Group | Description  ---|--------------|------------  A | impressions | Number of times product is shown in a banner  B | clicks | Number of clicks on product  C | cost | Amount spent for clicks on products  D | saleUnits | Number of products sold attributed to clicks  E | revenue | Revenue generated by sales  F | CR = Conversion Rate | salesUnits / clicks  G | CPO = Cost Per Order | cost / salesUnits  H | COS = Cost of Sale | cost / revenue  I | ROAS = Return On Add Spend | revenue / cost                The last six metrics can be computed in two ways depending on the policy to count only  the sales that result from clicks on the same sellers product in a banner  (same-seller) or not (any-seller).  Reporting can be controlled by `clickAttributionPolicy`.                The 9 (or 15) metric values appear in the output as the final 9 (or 15) columns.                ## Filtering                The results can be filtered by date or count.                Filtering the results to events  that happened in a time interval is done by setting the `startDate` and  `endDate` filter parameters using the `yyyy-MM-DD` format. The start date  includes all events timestamped since the beginning of that day while the end  date includes events until the end of day. The maximum duration of the date  range is 1 year. If the aggregation interval is `hour`, then the maximum  duration of the date range is 1 month. Note that month and year aggregate values  may contain partial data for the interval if filtering by date.                Filtering the results to a maximum number of data rows is done by setting the  `count` filter parameter. When combined with startDate this can be used to perform  simple pagination.                ## Response Format                The representation format can be specified by MIME values in the Accept header.  For now the only supported values for the accept header is `application/json` and  `text/csv`.                ```json  {     \"columns\": [ \"campaignId\", \"month\", \"impressions\", \"clicks\", \"cost\", \"saleUnits\", \"revenue\", \"cr\", \"cpo\", \"cos\", \"roas\" ],     \"data\": [         [168423, \"2019-05-01\", 3969032, 13410, 1111.295, 985, 190758099, 0.073, 1.128, 0.000, 171653.880 ],         [168423, \"2019-06-01\", 8479603, 25619, 2190.705, 740, 152783656, 0.028, 2.960, 0.000, 69741.775 ]         ],     \"rows\": 2  }  ```                The JSON result is an object with three fields (`columns`, `data`, and `rows`). The  “columns” array acts as the header for the data rows. The categorical dimension  column comes first and consists of the campaign id.  The interval column comes next and defines the aggregation period.  The interval size is  determined by the `intervalSize` parameter. This is followed by either nine or  fifteen metrics columns. The first three metrics (impressions, clicks, and cost)  always appear. The remaining depend on the `clickAttributionPolicy` parameter.                The “data” array contains data rows whose values match the entries in the  “columns” array. Id dimensions are numbers while name and date dimensions are strings. The metrics are JSON objects  whose type is number. Some of these are natural numbers (e.g. clicks and  impressions) whereas others are decimal values. A divide by zero yields null. The  currency is assumed to be the local currency established by the advertiser.                The “row” value is a count of the number of rows in the data array, and can be  used to check the integrity of the data.                Further information on the campaign or seller (e.g. the seller name) can be  obtained from the existing V1 or V2 endpoints using the campaign and/or seller  ID values.

Get stats by seller-campaign.

## Dimensions                Get performance statistics aggregated for _seller campaigns_.The campaign id, seller id, and  seller name appear in the first three columns of the output. These are followed by the interval  size column.                Aggregation can be done by `hour`, `day`, `month`, or `year`. The aggregation  interval size is controlled by `intervalSize`. The remaining columns are metrics.                ## Metrics                The metrics reported by this endpoint are                .  | Metric Group | Description  ---|--------------|------------  A | impressions | Number of times product is shown in a banner  B | clicks | Number of clicks on product  C | cost | Amount spent for clicks on products  D | saleUnits | Number of products sold attributed to clicks  E | revenue | Revenue generated by sales  F | CR = Conversion Rate | salesUnits / clicks  G | CPO = Cost Per Order | cost / salesUnits  H | COS = Cost of Sale | cost / revenue  I | ROAS = Return On Add Spend | revenue / cost                The last six metrics can be computed in two ways depending on the policy to count only  the sales that result from clicks on the same sellers product in a banner  (same-seller) or not (any-seller).

Get stats by seller.

## Dimensions                Get performance statistics aggregated for _sellers_. The seller id appears  in the output in the first column and the seller name appears in the second.                Aggregation can be done by `hour`, `day`, `month`, or `year`. The aggregation  interval size is controlled by `intervalSize`. The time interval appears in  the output as the second column.                ## Metrics                The metrics reported by this endpoint are                .  | Metric Group | Description  ---|--------------|------------  A | impressions | Number of times product is shown in a banner  B | clicks | Number of clicks on product  C | cost | Amount spent for clicks on products  D | saleUnits | Number of products sold attributed to clicks  E | revenue | Revenue generated by sales  F | CR = Conversion Rate | salesUnits / clicks  G | CPO = Cost Per Order | cost / salesUnits  H | COS = Cost of Sale | cost / revenue  I | ROAS = Return On Add Spend | revenue / cost                The last six metrics can be computed in two ways depending on the policy to count only  the sales that result from clicks on the same sellers product in a banner  (same-seller) or not (any-seller).  Reporting can be controlled by `clickAttributionPolicy`.                The 9 (or 15) metric values appear in the output as the final 9 (or 15) columns.                ## Filtering                The results can be filtered by date or count.                Filtering the results to events  that happened in a time interval is done by setting the `startDate` and  `endDate` filter parameters using the `yyyy-MM-DD` format. The start date  includes all events timestamped since the beginning of that day while the end  date includes events until the end of day. The maximum duration of the date  range is 1 year.
